How to run

2nd and 3rd task
Open the code task2&3_Sarsa_4moves_&_8moves
for switching from one task to another (i.e from 4 to 8 moves and vica versa) just change the num_actions to 8 or 4 by removing it as comment commenting appropriately and the whole code will run showing the respective plot and it saves them in the plots folder
you can change any variable where they are declared to any feasible values and the variables names are also appropriate to what they should be.

4th task
Open the code task4_stochastic_sarsa 
here also you don't have to do anything but to just select num_actions(no. of actions) to 8 or 4 by removing it as comment and after running the code it will show the plot and save them in the plot folder as well.
Here also you can change any variable to whatever value if feasible 

5th task
here you don't need to do anything just run the code and it will show the plots and save them with appropriate name in plot folder.
here also you can also change any variable to any feasible values.

while running the 2,3& 4th task please ensure that the num_actions defined at the start are appropriate. However nnumber of actions is showed in the plot as well.
Instead of un commenting you can only change the values of num_actions as well.
